Assign 3.2: Programmed the JavaScript code.  Finished reviewing lectures for second time much of the lectures and reviewed the source material for JavaScript coding.  Much difficulty, piazza posts were very helpful along with the
lecture code.  Assignment felt beyond what we had really had a chance to learn, much difficulty.  Felt that most of my work was appending the lecture code to fit the requirements of the assignment.
